Project Title: Modelling the behaviour of the Primary Visual Cortex

The project uses spiking neural networks. As Theyre more biologically realisitc than ANN's. The project intended to model the cortex as accurately as possible. The learning algorithm used is Spike Timing dependent plasticity (STDP) and uses the Izhikevich model to simulate the indvidual neuron behaviour.

Included demo of input from webcam, converted into an image represented by neuron spikes to emulate a neuromorphic camera. These inputs then feed into a singular Izhikevich neuron. It is a singular neuron to ensure demonstration ran at acceptable speed.
